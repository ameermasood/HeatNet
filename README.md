# 6D Pose Estimation via Keypoint Heatmap Regression with RGB-D Residual Neural Networks

This repository provides the official implementation of our research on 6D Object Pose Estimation, featuring a novel RGB-D cross-fusion architecture.

Our modular framework achieves a highly competitive mean ADD-based accuracy of 92.41% on the LINEMOD dataset by combining state-of-the-art object detection with dense keypoint heatmap regression.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emirmasood/HeatNet.git
cd HeatNet
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Data and Models

Due to GitHub's file size restrictions, download large files separately:

* **Dataset:** [Google Drive Data Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bMuIT9NpPXCQPV6SGFvr6aIEn42B3BZ-?usp=sharing)
* **ResNet Checkpoints:** [ResNet Checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14pTckwpHFnaL27vCwQ3DRbv9XOCgZZOM?usp=drive_link)
* **YOLOv10m pretrained weights:** [YOLOv10m Checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRdriU3u85oxcL0CPeIhJBxX795iENse/view?usp=drive_link)

Place downloaded files into their respective folders as indicated in the folder structure above.

### Step 4: Run the Full Pipeline

```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/end_to_end/ph5_01_end_to_end.ipynb
```
